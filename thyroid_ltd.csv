ADDENDUM: Cytology results from FNA biopsy of left supraclavicular lesion demonstrates findings suspicious for EBV related lymphoma. A more definitive diagnosis cannot be rendered on limited sample due to scant cellularity. The cytology results are concordant with imaging findings.

Cytology results of right thyroid nodule at the lower pole are nondiagnostic with insufficient follicular epithelium. FNA biopsy can be repeated, if clinically indicated.

The thyroid isthmus measures 2 mm in thickness.

The left thyroid lobe measures 4.2 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm (volume 6.6 mL) with homogeneous echotexture containing isoechoic vascularized nodule at interpolar region measuring 0.9 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm, hypoechoic vascularized nodule at interpolar to lower pole region measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm with macrocalcification and isoechoic nodule lower pole measuring 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm.

In the left supraclavicular region, there is heterogeneous hypoechoic vascularized mass separate from the thyroid gland measuring 2.1 x 1.3 x 1.9 cm.

INTERPRETATION:

Right thyroid nodule at interpolar region classified as TIRADS 4 lesion and does not satisfy size criteria for follow up or biopsy (i.e. less than 1 cm).

Right thyroid mass at interpolar to lower pole region classified as TIRADS 4 lesion and satisfies size criteria for FNA biopsy (i.e. greater than 1.5 cm).

HISTORY: The patient was sent to the department for consideration of lymph node biopsy. Previous thyroid biopsy in the past both in India and at this center in August, 2019.

COMPARISON: The prior imaging studies from this center July and August, 2019 were reviewed. There was a TR 4 nodule in the mid/lower pole left lobe in August, 2019 measuring 1.4 cm in maximum dimension. The most recent outside ultrasound from Finchgate x-ray July 27, 2020 was reviewed which mentioned some lymph nodes measuring up to 0.5 cm in short axis dimension.

FINDINGS:

The neck was evaluated. The lymph nodes identified are normal in size, none larger than 0.6 cm in short axis dimension. Most have a subtle eccentric notched contour, suggesting a hilum. There is no evidence of nonhilar blood flow on Doppler interrogation.

As the lymph nodes are normal in size, no lymph node biopsy was arranged.

Request was made for aspiration of left thyroid bed nodule. Informed consent was obtained. There is a very tiny nodule seen in the left thyroid bed barely visible by ultrasound and measuring about 6 x 4 mm. Targeting this nodule for aspiration was difficult as the nodule is tiny and adjacent to the carotid artery. Nonetheless FNA was performed and the needle did appear to traverse the nodule. After 2 passes the nodule could not be well seen any longer so a third pass was not performed. Patient tolerated well with no immediate complications.,1

"******** ADDENDUM #1 ********
ADDENDUM: Cytology results from FNA biopsy of thyroid nodule at interpolar region of right thyroid lobe demonstrate findings suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. Cannot completely exclude possibility of papillary neoplasm or noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary like nuclear features The cytology results are concordant with imaging findings.

Cytology results from FNA biopsy of exophytic nodule adjacent to the lower pole of right thyroid lobe  demonstrate benign thyroid tissue. Evaluation is limited by very scant cellularity. The aspirate is composed benign epithelial cells in clusters and microfollicles in a background of colloid. Given provided history, it is impossible to distinguish benign follicular cells from parathyroid cells on cytomorphology alone. There is insufficient material for ancillary testing. The cytology results are indeterminate with respect to imaging findings.

If there is ongoing clinical suspicion of parathyroid adenoma (i.e. history of hyperparathyroidism and/or hypercalcemia), parathyroid nuclear scan would be recommended prior to repeat FNA biopsy.

******** ORIGINAL REPORT ********
PROCEDURE NOTE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained following a thorough discussion of potential risks and complications. Using sonographic guidance and sterile technique, the nodule in the right thyroid isthmus was targeted. Following anesthetization of the skin and subcutaneous tissues using 1-2 mL of 1% plain lidocaine, a total of three 25 gauge FNA biopsies were obtained and sent to cytopathology.

INTERPRETATION:

Successful ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of right thyroid isthmus nodule and exophytic nodule inferior to right thyroid lobe.

The exophytic nodule inferiorly could represent exophytic thyroid nodule or parathyroid adenoma. If the FNA biopsy result is indeterminate, parathyroid nuclear scan would be recommended prior to repeat FNA biopsy.",>=1

Addendum: The imaging obtained during the procedure and the prior imaging 21/1/2021 was reviewed. It also reviewed at the time of the procedure. It was noted at the time of the procedure that the hypoechoic nodule which contained echogenic foci is at the junction of the mid left lobe and the inferior aspect of the left side of the isthmus. It was not located in the lower pole of the left lobe. There was a a further nodule, complex but predominantly cystic (Ti-Rads 2) in the mid left lobe located lateral to the inferior aspect of the left side of the isthmus. This extends into the lower pole. This complex nodule is not a suspicious nodule. Based on dimensions of the aspirated nodule, description and Ti-Rads estimation, the correct nodule was aspirated at the time of the thyroid aspiration. This nodule looks suspicious on imaging, at least Ti-Rads 4.

Addendum: The FNA indicates abundant macrophages and rare fragments of benign follicular epithelium. Cyst contents were also noted. The Ti-Rads 3 nodule previously described in the right lobe was aspirated. This nodule is predominantly solid with anterior  cystic component. The images were reviewed. The needle utilized for FNA is seen to traverse the region of interest i.e. the previous described complex predominantly solid nodule. Please note that this nodule extends to the thyroid capsule with no intervening normal thyroid tissue between the capsule and the nodule. The report of normal thyroid tissue is therefore surprising as the needle did not traverse normal thyroid tissue. The needle traverses both the solid and cystic component. For completeness, the FNA can be repeated with the needle directed only to the solid components of the nodule.

Successful ultrasound-guided FNA biopsies of nodules in the right lower and left mid thyroid poles..",>=1
"History: For FNA of 2 thyroid nodules

Correlation is made with the ultrasound images and report from February 11, 2021.

FINDINGS: Heterogeneous right thyroid nodule which is vascular with cystic as well as solid regions measuring 5.9 x 3.3 x 3.1 cm. Nodule on the left with anechoic center and isoechoic surrounding tissue 2.8 x 1.4 x 2.2 cm.

The risks and procedures reviewed with the patient. Consent obtained. The area cleansed. Under ultrasound guidance fine-needle aspirates performed with sonographic confirmation the needle traverses the nodular region of concern in the right initially. 2 passes were made. This was follow-up by fine-needle aspirate performed of the left thyroid nodule with ultrasound confirmation needle tip also in the nodular region of concern. No immediate post aspiration complications.

Opinion: FNA performed of both the right and left dominant thyroid nodules.",>=1
"History: For fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodule and lymph node if needed

Correlation is made with the thyroid ultrasound from February 12, 2021 and its report.

Nodule in the left lobe measuring up to 2.4 cm is targeted as suggested on the report.

TECHNIQUE: The procedure and risks were reviewed with the patient and consent obtained. The nodule in the left lower thyroid gland with a hypoechoic center is seen measuring 2.4 x 1.7 x 1.3 cm. There is flow primarily peripherally with some within the lesion.

Under ultrasound guidance after the area was cleansed fine-needle aspirates were performed with sonographic confirmation needle tip is in the nodular region of concern. No immediate post aspiration complications.

Opinion: Fine-needle aspirate performed of the dominant nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland.",1
"History: For FNA of left lower thyroid nodule TR 4 greater than 1.5 cm

Correlation is made with the February 16, 2021 ultrasound.

FINDINGS: The solid slightly hypoechoic nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland towards the lower pole vascular 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.9 cm is again identified.

After the procedure and risks was reviewed with the patient and consent obtained the area cleansed. Under ultrasound guidance fine-needle aspirates were performed with sonographic confirmation needle tip within the nodular region of concern. Overall patient tolerated procedure well with no immediate post biopsy competitions.

Opinion: FNA performed of the left lower lobe thyroid nodule.",1
