There is a heterogeneous the right lobe thyroid mass readily evident by today's ultrasound and a CT neck from 20 April 2020. Correlating to the CT appears to completely replacement of the right lobe thyroid with a heterogeneous mass extending posterior to the trachea likely into the posterior left lobe of the thyroid. On ultrasound there appear to be additional hypoechoic lesions in the adjacent strap muscles anteriorly as well as some necrotic lymph nodes along the anterior jugular vein. As such this is a very suspicious right thyroid mass for malignancy, with extrathyroidal  involvement and suspected metastatic lymphadenopathy in the right neck.

Informed consent was obtained including explanation of risks including bleeding and neck swelling. The chances of obtaining an inadequate specimen also reviewed.

Following this, fine needle aspiration was performed of the right lobe thyroid gland. In a separate container aspiration was performed also one of the abnormal appearing lymph nodes in the adjacent neck.

The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, despite his apparent mild visible shortness of breath which was present pre-procedure, and there were no immediate complications.
