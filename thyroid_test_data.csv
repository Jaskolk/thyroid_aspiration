Bilateral simple breast cysts cysts are seen. The largest on the right breast measures 4.1 x 0.8 x 2.7 cm at the 9:00 radian, previously 2.9 x 1.5 x 5.8 cm.

The largest on the left measures 3.3 x 1.4 x 2.7 cm at the 2:00 radian, previously 3.8 x 1.2 x 3.2 cm.

An informed consent was obtained from the patient for aspiration. The benefits and the risks, including recurring cysts or new cysts were discussed.

The left cyst was targeted first. This cyst is obvious on visual inspection with a focal bulge. With aseptic technique and 1 percent lidocaine as local anesthetics, aspiration was performed. 5 mL of turbid greenish-brownish fluid was aspirated and sent for cytology. The cyst was collapsed following aspiration.

The right cyst was then aspirated with the same technique. 4 mL of similar turbid greenish-brownish fluid was aspirated and sent for cytology. The cyst was collapsed following aspiration. There was no communication with the adjacent smaller cysts. Since the smaller cyst was not significantly bordering the patient, no further aspiration was performed.

The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.

Using sonographic guidance and sterile technique, the nodule in the right midpole was targeted. A total of three 25 gauge FNA biopsies were obtained and sent to cytopathology. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.

INTERPRETATION:

Successful ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of isoechoic nodule in the right midpole.",2021-03-17,1
16912540.0,N000851028,PEPPIN,"FNA BIOPSY OF THYROID

HISTORY: Request for thyroid nodule biopsy.

COMPARISON: Ultrasound March 11, 2021.

PROCEDURE:

The material risks (including hemorrhage and infection) of the procedure were explained to the patient, and informed consent was obtained.

Following sterile prep, drape, and local anesthesia, a 25 gauge 1.5"" needle was advanced into the lesion under direct sonographic guidance. Adequate samples were obtained.

The samples were placed in appropriate fluid and sent for analysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION:

Technically successful FNA ultrasound-guided biopsy of:

1. 4 cm TR 4 nodule right lobe. Centered in the midpole.

2. The hypoechoic tissue in the expected location of the left lobe of thyroid (patient is status post left hemithyroidectomy many years ago in India). This tissue measures close to 2.8 cm in size. If it is thyroid tissue, it is technically a TR 4 nodule.

HISTORY: Biopsy requested of 3 discrete nodules, 2 on the left and one on the right.

COMPARISON: None available.

PROCEDURE:

The material risks (including hemorrhage and infection) of the procedure were explained to the patient, and informed consent was obtained.

Following sterile prep, drape, and local anesthesia, a 25 gauge 1.5"" needle was advanced into each lesion under direct sonographic guidance. Adequate samples were obtained.

The samples were placed in appropriate fluid and sent for analysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION:

Technically successful FNA ultrasound-guided biopsy of:

1. The solid and cystic nodule midpole right lobe, measuring 1.9 cm in maximum dimension at the time of biopsy on image 2. The solid component was targeted.

2. Solid hypoechoic nodule lower pole left lobe measuring 1.1 cm in maximum dimension at the time of biopsy. This was described as a TR 5 nodule, but there is a TR 4 nodule.

3. Solid and cystic hypoechoic noncalcified midpole nodule, 1.5 cm in size on image 6. This nodule was selected for biopsy, though it appears that the prior study from March 12, 2021 suggested biopsy of the nodule bridging the lower pole and isthmus on image 38 of that study.

In any case, follow-up is recommended for the nodule which was not biopsied, bridging the isthmus and lower pole left lobe. A follow-up ultrasound in 6 months would be reasonable.

PROCEDURE:

The material risks (including hemorrhage and infection) of the procedure were explained to the patient, and informed consent was obtained.

Following sterile prep, drape, and local anesthesia, a 25 gauge 1.5"" needle was advanced into Ti-Rads 5 nodule in the left lower under direct sonographic guidance. This was a very challenging procedure. Several approaches were utilized. The needle tip was positioned in the nodule on 2 separate occasions.

The samples were placed in appropriate fluid and sent for analysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications.
