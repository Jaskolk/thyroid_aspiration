HISTORY: The patient was sent to the department for consideration of lymph node biopsy. Previous thyroid biopsy in the past both in India and at this center in August, 2019.

COMPARISON: The prior imaging studies from this center July and August, 2019 were reviewed. There was a TR 4 nodule in the mid/lower pole left lobe in August, 2019 measuring 1.4 cm in maximum dimension. The most recent outside ultrasound from Finchgate x-ray July 27, 2020 was reviewed which mentioned some lymph nodes measuring up to 0.5 cm in short axis dimension.

FINDINGS:

The neck was evaluated. The lymph nodes identified are normal in size, none larger than 0.6 cm in short axis dimension. Most have a subtle eccentric notched contour, suggesting a hilum. There is no evidence of nonhilar blood flow on Doppler interrogation.

As the lymph nodes are normal in size, no lymph node biopsy was arranged.

Given that the biopsy result from the previous thyroid biopsy August, 2019 was nondiagnostic with acellular specimen, a repeat left lobe thyroid biopsy was performed.

PROCEDURE:

The material risks (including hemorrhage and infection) of the procedure were explained to the patient, and informed consent was obtained.

 Nodule in the right lobe.

The images were compared to the more remote study performed 2014. The current study demonstrates a heterogeneous right lobe. There is a more focal hypoechoic area present at the posterior aspect of the midright lobe. It measures 2.4 x 1.1 x 1.2 cm. It is solid. There are no calcifications. Review of prior imaging demonstrates a probable similar hypoechoic area not greatly changed. The findings could represent the sequela of thyroiditis which could be the etiology of the relatively dry aspirate. Regardless, the FNA was performed. A repeat aspiration is not recommended if the current aspiration is nondiagnostic. Rather would recommend a follow-up ultrasound in 6 months to reassess and compare with 2014.

HISTORY: Previous nondiagnostic biopsy. Peripherally calcified thyroid nodule right lobe.

COMPARISON: The prior CT from July 30, 2020 was reviewed.

PROCEDURE:

The material risks (including hemorrhage and infection) of the procedure were explained to the patient, and informed consent was obtained.

Following sterile prep, drape, and local anesthesia, a 18-gauge super core needle was advanced into the heavily peripherally calcified nodule right lobe. Advancement was difficult due to the peripheral calcification. The superior most aspect of the nodule was targeted, and 2 reasonable core biopsies were obtained from this region, in addition to a questionable core biopsy of the midportion of the heavily calcified nodule.

The samples were placed in appropriate fluid and sent for analysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications.

HISTORY: Request for repeat biopsy of a nodule in the left lobe.

COMPARISON: Several priors. The left lobe is diffusely heterogeneous and nodular. A recent ultrasound identified a more focally prominent echogenic nodule in the left lobe. An aspiration was requested. The patient has a low riding multinodular goiter and has difficulty breathing quietly. Prominent thyroid motion is present throughout the aspiration.

PROCEDURE:

The material risks (including hemorrhage and infection) of the procedure were explained to the patient, and informed consent was obtained.

Following sterile prep, drape, and local anesthesia, a 25 gauge 1.5"" needle was advanced into the lesion under direct sonographic guidance. Adequate samples were obtained.

The samples were placed in appropriate fluid and sent for analysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION:

Technically challenging FNA ultrasound-guided biopsy of:

 Nodule in the left lobe. This is the second attempt. There is prominent excursion of the thyroid gland on respiration.

I do not recommend a repeat aspiration if this is nondiagnostic. Rather would recommend follow-up imaging assessment.

I have reviewed the images on the prior ultrasound dated 18/9/2020.. The nodule is predominantly solid. It is mildly hyperechoic compared to adjacent thyroid tissue. Based on Ti-Rads, this is a Ti-Rads 3 nodule. FNA is not usually indicated in a Ti-Rads 3 nodule is less than 2.5 cm.

ADDENDUM: Cytology results from FNA biopsy of thyroid nodule at interpolar region of right thyroid lobe demonstrate findings suspicious for a follicular neoplasm. Cannot completely exclude possibility of papillary neoplasm or noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary like nuclear features The cytology results are concordant with imaging findings.

Cytology results from FNA biopsy of exophytic nodule adjacent to the lower pole of right thyroid lobe  demonstrate benign thyroid tissue. Evaluation is limited by very scant cellularity. The aspirate is composed benign epithelial cells in clusters and microfollicles in a background of colloid. Given provided history, it is impossible to distinguish benign follicular cells from parathyroid cells on cytomorphology alone. There is insufficient material for ancillary testing. The cytology results are indeterminate with respect to imaging findings.

If there is ongoing clinical suspicion of parathyroid adenoma (i.e. history of hyperparathyroidism and/or hypercalcemia), parathyroid nuclear scan would be recommended prior to repeat FNA biopsy.

******** ORIGINAL REPORT ********
PROCEDURE NOTE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained following a thorough discussion of potential risks and complications. Using sonographic guidance and sterile technique, the nodule in the right thyroid isthmus was targeted. Following anesthetization of the skin and subcutaneous tissues using 1-2 mL of 1% plain lidocaine, a total of three 25 gauge FNA biopsies were obtained and sent to cytopathology.

Using similar technique described above, the exophytic isoechoic nodule inferior to the lower pole right thyroid lobe was biopsied. A total of 3 25-gauge FNA biopsies were obtained and sent to cytopathology. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.

INTERPRETATION:

Successful ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of right thyroid isthmus nodule and exophytic nodule inferior to right thyroid lobe.

The exophytic nodule inferiorly could represent exophytic thyroid nodule or parathyroid adenoma. If the FNA biopsy result is indeterminate, parathyroid nuclear scan would be recommended prior to repeat FNA biopsy.",

Addendum: The imaging obtained during the procedure and the prior imaging 21/1/2021 was reviewed. It also reviewed at the time of the procedure. It was noted at the time of the procedure that the hypoechoic nodule which contained echogenic foci is at the junction of the mid left lobe and the inferior aspect of the left side of the isthmus. It was not located in the lower pole of the left lobe. There was a a further nodule, complex but predominantly cystic (Ti-Rads 2) in the mid left lobe located lateral to the inferior aspect of the left side of the isthmus. This extends into the lower pole. This complex nodule is not a suspicious nodule. Based on dimensions of the aspirated nodule, description and Ti-Rads estimation, the correct nodule was aspirated at the time of the thyroid aspiration. This nodule looks suspicious on imaging, at least Ti-Rads 4.

Addendum: The FNA indicates abundant macrophages and rare fragments of benign follicular epithelium. Cyst contents were also noted. The Ti-Rads 3 nodule previously described in the right lobe was aspirated. This nodule is predominantly solid with anterior  cystic component. The images were reviewed. The needle utilized for FNA is seen to traverse the region of interest i.e. the previous described complex predominantly solid nodule. Please note that this nodule extends to the thyroid capsule with no intervening normal thyroid tissue between the capsule and the nodule. The report of normal thyroid tissue is therefore surprising as the needle did not traverse normal thyroid tissue. The needle traverses both the solid and cystic component. For completeness, the FNA can be repeated with the needle directed only to the solid components of the nodule.
