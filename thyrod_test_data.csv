Comparison: 8/12/2020 and prior.

Bilateral simple breast cysts cysts are seen. The largest on the right breast measures 4.1 x 0.8 x 2.7 cm at the 9:00 radian, previously 2.9 x 1.5 x 5.8 cm.

The largest on the left measures 3.3 x 1.4 x 2.7 cm at the 2:00 radian, previously 3.8 x 1.2 x 3.2 cm.

An informed consent was obtained from the patient for aspiration. The benefits and the risks, including recurring cysts or new cysts were discussed.

The left cyst was targeted first. This cyst is obvious on visual inspection with a focal bulge. With aseptic technique and 1 percent lidocaine as local anesthetics, aspiration was performed. 5 mL of turbid greenish-brownish fluid was aspirated and sent for cytology. The cyst was collapsed following aspiration.

The right cyst was then aspirated with the same technique. 4 mL of similar turbid greenish-brownish fluid was aspirated and sent for cytology. The cyst was collapsed following aspiration. There was no communication with the adjacent smaller cysts. Since the smaller cyst was not significantly bordering the patient, no further aspiration was performed.

The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.

 The isoechoic nodule in the lower pole of the right lobe of the thyroid gland was aspirated under sonographic control. This patient has a very poor tolerance for the procedure. This was due more to extreme anxiety than pain. There were no immediate complications. 3 passes were performed.

The second lesion identified exophytic at the lower pole right thyroid appears vascular and deep closely related to the right carotid space vessels. On some images it has the appearance of a blood vessel. It was not aspirated. I note the patient has a biochemical diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.
